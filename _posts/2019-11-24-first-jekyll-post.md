title: My first post using Jekyll, and Github pages
---

I really wanted a website so decided to make oune using Github pages, because someone suggested it to me. 
It took me 3 days, and multiple attemps, but I am finally starting to understand how to make it work, and 
I cannot wait to create more content on this site.
